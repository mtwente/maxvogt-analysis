## Tools

_maxvogt-analysis_ contains research data – mainly geodata and Jupyter Notebooks – related to a research project on the railway station designs by Max Vogt and the spatial syntax features.

The analysis is split up in Jupyter Notebooks that are available in this repository and can be launched either locally or using Binder.

The most important tool used for the spatial analysis is **momepy**[^1] by Martin Fleischmann and James Gaboardi. See the [documentation](https://docs.momepy.org/en/stable/index.html) for momepy examples and tutorials.

Geodata used for the analysis is retrieved from OpenStreetMap using the **OSMnx**[^2] package by Geoff Boeing. See [readthedocs.io](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for documentation.

## Project Report

See [mtwente.github.io/maxvogt](https://mtwente.github.io/maxvogt) for a collection of buildings and smaller physical structures designed by Max Vogt. There, results of the analyses in this repository are available as collection items. For each object, a short description is provided with information on the object's spatial context and its design features from an urban design perspective.
