# maxvogt-analysis

This repository contains data for spatial analyses that are part of a research project on spatial/urban design features of railway-related built structures designed by the Swiss architect Max Vogt. The data in this repository is openly available to everyone and is intended to support reproducible research.

Results of the analyses are accessible in an [online collection of Vogt's buildings](https://mtwente.github.io/maxvogt) and presented as a [poster](/docs/abstract.html) at the [Spatial Humanities 2024](https://spathum.uni-bamberg.de/) conference at the University of Bamberg.

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is based on the [Open Research Data Template](https://github.com/maehr/open-research-data-template) by [@maehr](https://www.github.com/maehr), follows the [Advanced Structure for Data Analysis](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-advanced.html) of _The Turing Way_ and is organized as follows:

- `analysis/`: notebooks used to retrieve and analyze the data
- `assets/`: images, logos, etc. used in the README and other documentation
- `data/`: data files
- `docs/`: documentation for the data and the repository
- `results/`: geodata output of the analysis notebooks

Additionally, there is a [Zotero group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5400359/sbb-max-vogt/library) with a collection of scientific articles and news reports that are of relevance for this project.

## Data Description

See [Workflow](/docs/workflow.html) for a description of the project workflow and the data obtained for this project.

## Installation

To run the analysis locally, create a new `conda` environment based on the `environment.yml` file.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment.

```bash
conda activate maxvogt
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook platform.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Pick a notebook from `analysis/` to start the spatial analysis for one of Max Vogt's buildings.
